You already set your global config for user.name and user.email.
To check if they are really applied, you can run:

🔹 Check only one config value
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email


👉 This will print exactly what you set (Nikhil Patil and your email).

🔹 Check all global configs
git config --global --list


👉 Shows everything set globally (user.name, user.email, any aliases, etc.).

🔹 Check local repo config

If you want to see configs only for this project, run:

git config --list


or

git config --local --list


👉 This shows settings inside .git/config of your current repo.

🔹 Check system + global + local (all combined)
git config --list --show-origin


👉 This will show where each setting comes from (system, global, or local file).

⚡ So in your case, if you run:

git config --global --list


you should see:

user.name=Nikhil Patil
user.email=np00668832@gmail.com





// git restore --staged <file> 


// git restore <file> 
This throws away your local modifications and restores the file content from the last committed state (HEAD).
Unstage a file (but keep changes in working directory):

git restore --staged <file>


👉 If you ran git add file.txt by mistake, this will remove it from staging, but keep your changes in the file.

Restore file from another commit/branch:

git restore --source=<commit_hash> <file>

👉 This will replace your file content with how it was in that commit.


//  Created the Branch  
git branch employee  // create a branch named employee 
git checkout employee // will switch to this branch employee from main . 


Meaning of the Codes
A = Added (untracked file added)
→ The file git_basic.json exists in your working directory but was not in the index/commit history of the branch you checked out.
Git is telling you: "I had to add this untracked file into the working tree."
M = Modified
→ The file learn.js is present in both branches, but its content was modified in your working directory compared to the commit you checked out.
Git is letting you know it merged in the modification instead of discarding it.





// HOW TO CREATE AND PUSH THE BRANCH. 
Here’s the proper workflow after you create a branch:

1️⃣ Create and switch to a branch
git checkout -b employee


or

git branch employee
git checkout employee

2️⃣ Make changes

Add new files or modify existing files in your working directory.

3️⃣ Stage your changes
git add .


or for specific files:

git add learn.js git_basic.json


This moves the changes to the staging area.

4️⃣ Commit the changes
git commit -m "Added employee branch changes"


This records the changes in your local branch history.

5️⃣ Push the branch to GitHub
git push origin employee


Now the employee branch will appear on GitHub.

Until you push, the branch exists only locally.

⚡ Important:
If you create a branch but don’t add, commit, and push, GitHub will not show it. Only your local Git will know about it.


4️⃣ Push the branch to GitHub
git push origin employee
Now the employee branch and your changes will appear on GitHub.
